<div class='container'>
  <h3>Intro</h3>
  
  <p>Hi there, this is a SPA (single page app) to search and browse artists, songs, albums, and everything in-between. 
  It's one of my personal projects that I recently built and added to my portfolio projects.</p>
  <p>I actually find it pretty useful.</p>

  <h3>Tech used</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>HTML 5</li>
    <li>CSS 3</li>
    <li>SCSS</li>
    <li>Bootstrap 4</li>
    <li>Bootswatch</li>
    <li>TypeScript 3</li>
    <li>Angular 7</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It uses the iTunes Search API to get and fetch data to display it to the user in a nice format with 
    interactive user interface.</p>
  <p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
</div>
