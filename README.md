This is a SPA (single page app) to search and browse artists, songs, albums, and everything in-between.

It's one of my personal projects that I recently built and added to my portfolio projects. 
  
I actually find it pretty useful.

## Tech used

HTML 5, CSS 3, SCSS, Bootstrap 4, Bootswatch, TypeScript 3, Angular 7.

It uses the iTunes Search API to get and fetch data to display it to the user in a nice format with interactive user interface. 

## How to run it

You need to install the dependencies, and devDependencies, then you can serve the app by starting your server.

So run the following commands:

$ npm install

$ npm start

NOTE: To open the browser window automatically after the app has been served, use the flag -open or just -o as follows:

$ ng serve -o

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
